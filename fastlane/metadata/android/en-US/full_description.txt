This open-source fork of Fossify File Manager adds <b>network file sharing via SMB</b> <i>(more protocols eg. SFTP/FTPS may be added in the future)</i>, among many other new features and improvements!

<b>Other features/improvements include:</b>
- Favorites have their own tab instead of a tiny menu bar option
- Favorites can be removed easily from the tab instead of via Menu -> Settings -> Manage Favorites
- Improved sharing support to more apps and MIME type detection (eg. HEIC images don't share correctly on main branch)
- Reverse sharing supported too! Share TO File Explore as a destination, allowing you to import images and files in from other apps/instant messengers instantly and choose where to save them.
- Improved thumbnail performance, also fully supports **thumbnails on remote shares!** (A very rare feature in file manager apps I've tried)
- Vastly improved search performance, searches show results asynchronously and can be cancelled at any time w/ back button
- Bulk jobs (copy/move/delete/etc) run in background and show a progress notification that allows cancelling them at any time
- Runs faster, many methods are more optimized
- Cleaner edge-to-edge UI w/ full display notch/cutout support
- Better touch keyboard handling (doesn't move tab bar up and block UI)
- Physical keyboard shortcuts (tested with Samsung DeX/Desktop Mode!)
- Stays in selection mode when rotating screen
- And more!
